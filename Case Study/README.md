# Case Study 

A Case Study camparing the answers generated by CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeT5(CTG) and CodeT5(CTG+NP).

The code question-answering set used in this study is CodeQA-Java dev set.

CodeBERT and CodeT5 are original pre-trained model after finetuning on CodeQA dataset.
CodeT5(CTG) is a CodeT5-based model on which we applied code-text generation pre-training for 10 epoch.
CodeT5(CTG+NP) is a CodeT5-based model on which we applied code-text generation pre-training for 10 epoch and noun prediction pre-training for 5 epoch. It's named CodeMaster in our paper.

## Files

The data of code question-answering set are in three files: 'CodeQA.code', 'CodeQA.question' and 'CodeQA.answer'.

The .output files stores the answers generated by each model.
